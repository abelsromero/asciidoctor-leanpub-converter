= Asciidoctor Leanpub Converter

Very early stages to showing a converter written in Groovy using the experimental
asciidoctorj-1.6.0 branch

Level 0 heading becomes a Leanpub part and creates a new part file

```
= This becomes a part
```

Level 1 heading becomes a Leanpub chapter. In addition if it is annotated with `[chapter]` it creates a new chapter file

```
[chapter]
== This becomes a chapter
```

Level 1 heading annotated with `[preface]` becomes a Leanpub preface

```
[preface]
== This is a preface
```
